abstract: >-
  As governments worldwide continue to release vast amounts
  of textual information, the need for efficient and
  insightful tools to extract, interpret and present this
  data has become increasingly critical. Towards solving
  this issue, we present the Bundestag-Mine: an environment
  that periodically retrieves pertinent data from the German
  parliament, parses and analyzes it using pipelines for
  natural language processing, and then displays the results
  in a web application that is publicly accessible.
  Bundestag-Mine helps to extract key information from
  parliamentary documents in a visually appealing manner for
  many use cases. For instance, the tool can be leveraged by
  journalists for news detection, lawyers for compliance
  checking, linguists for discourse analysis, and the broad
  public to inform themselves about the positions of
  political party members on a topic.
